## About the project:
We had to build an app that gets data from the GIPHY Developers API. The specs are as follows:

  * When the user clicks on a button, the page should grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.
  * When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.
  * Under every gif, display its rating (PG, G, so on).
  * Only once you get images displaying with button presses should you move on to the next step.
  * Add a form to your page takes the value from a user input box and adds it into your topics array. Then make a function call that takes each topic in the array remakes the buttons on the page.

## Techologies used to build:
  * HTML
  * CSS
  * Bootstrap
  * jQuery
    * Ajax
  * Javascript
  * GIPHY Developers API

## Methodology:

I went back and reviewd the class activies on Ajax to build this app. I also consulted the jQuery docs and w3schools website. I ran into some issues with the start-stop function but after discussing with my class-mates, I found out it was mostly a syntax issue. Loved this project!
